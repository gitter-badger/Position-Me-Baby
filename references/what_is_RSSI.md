In telecomminications, RSSI (received signal strength indicator) is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal.

RSSI is of no use for a user of hotspot created by the router. But coz the signal strength can vary greatly and affect the functionality of networking, IEEE 802.11 devices often make the measurements available to all .

About IEEE 802.11: 
IEEE 802.11 is set of specifications of media access control (sublayer of second layer of the OSI model) and physical layer (the 1st layer of the OSI model). 

RSSI output is ADC analog value. It can be sampled by an ADC and the resulting codecs(data) can be used further. The RSSI in 802.11 is an indication of power level being received.
But 802.11 standard does not define any equations of power (in watts) and the DC analog value we get. But you can say for sure that if the RSSI value increases, the power increases.
In order to calculate probably calibration based on experimental data will help.

RSSI has been replaced in most of the scenarios with RCPI(received channel power indication)
